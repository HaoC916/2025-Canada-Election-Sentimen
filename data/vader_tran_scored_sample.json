{"author":"InfoSec_Nut","body":"I am a lifelong Red Tory. I have never forgiven Peter MacKay for merging with the Canadian Alliance after he promised us all he would not when we made him leader.  The CPC party attempted to pull us to the right, and many of us left the party.  Andrew Screer did nothing to excite us to return, Erin O'Toole was closer to the middle, but such a butt kisser to Harper, he never gained our trust.  Then came Poilievre, who went even further right; he is so far right he is no longer a conservative, but a Libertarian.  \n\nIt is my opinion that the CPC has two choices.  First and smartest, would be to come back to the traditional PC area center with policies that lean slightly left or right.  That will get them support in the east.  The second, continue playing to their base in mostly Alberta and Saskatchewan, become a regional party like the Bloc, and give up the idea of ever forming government, become a spoiler party.\n\nCanada is not a far-right country. Harper knew this, and even though many Canadians saw him as a Blue Tory, he was even farther to the right.  It wasn't until his 3rd election victory that he got his majority, and he started pulling to the far right.  This movement helped propel the Liberal majority in 2015.  \n\nWhen Canadians are looking for safety, they always tend to go home to the Liberals now.  The CPC could take back some of that support if they were less extreme, not driving their message with division, and returned to the center of the political spectrum.  Until they learn this, I fully expect them to be the party of the protest voter, and forming government may always be out just out of reach.

We didn't even get a costed platform until after early voting ended.

{"author":"suuuuuuck","body":"Well, maybe. But a couple things.\n\nThe libertarian masquerading as a right wing populist bit is a good example of why PP is not hitting the mark here. He is not a naturally charismatic or convincing leader, so his culture war rhetoric comes across as both toxic and artificial at the same time. He is an unlikeable person to moderates due to the embracing of the shitty trump-style divisive bullshit that we are all seeing play out in the worst way down south. But because he is actually just a politics dweeb and not the strong man he is trying to be, he's also alienating people when he fails to live up to the charade. His voting record is not impressive and his policies are in service to the rich under the guise of populism. He might not have dictatorial aspirations like trump, but he's been using the same blame/scapegoat/distract playbook to advance the same sorts of economic and political goals that advance the rich and powerful at the expense of the working class. The libs have just done a terrible job of enacting an alternative so it's fertile ground for this to take root. Much like how the Democrats insisting on milquetoast neoliberalism disaffected enough people that they voted for the dude now dismantling their entire country. The liberals shit the bed not for being too left, but for being too, well, liberal. \n\nWhen you say canadians missed their chance for a liberal-lite, I think you might be missing the point. The CPC missed their chance by choosing someone like PP. Canadians haven't yet missed their chance, as things are looking pretty good that they'll get it in electing Carney. Most normal people don't want a guy shrieking about terminally online culture war garbage and embracing shit stirrers and right wing grifters. They just want someone who will steadily steer the ship. You might not care about psychos supporting pp, but many people do. Carney was hailed by conservatives within your lifetime as a respectable and competent professional and conservative. It's not that he turned into a communist or something, it's that that's what conservatism in this country used to look like. By aligning himself so aggressively with such an extreme segment of the right wing, PP was, to many, a distasteful option but the only alternative to an unpopular trudeau. In Carney, they get the parts they want right now from a more conservative candidate without all the gross and dumb shit. Canada is *not* America, we don't need MAGA. We need competent, capable leadership that still recognizes the value of the things we care about in this country. \n\nFinally, Ford is absolutely a conservative. You sound like you are young and maybe are getting your political theory from some less than scholarly sources. The definition of a conservative is not whether a candidate supports another candidate. He is also absolutely playing politics. It seems that he recognised that he didn't want to tie his brand to PP and, as much as I dislike the man, that looks like it's paying off.

{"author":"Remarkable_Vanilla34","body":"Here's the thing about rifles. It's political. Part of it is about political tribalism, guns are seen as a \"right wing\" issue, and some left-wing people are on board to punish people they disagree with politically. The political right does it to and probably more often. You can see it in the comments about \"tiny weiners,\" \"it's a stupid hobby,\" etc. A lot of this issue is just supported by the perspective that it only hurts the most conservative people, and in reality, that's not true. It actually drives progressive and reasonable people further right. \n\nNext is social justice advocates like Polysesouvient. People who link gun ownership to misogynisy, domestic violence, etc. It's not a logical stance, and at its core, it's about making all guns illegal. Their arguments don't hold water when their based on models of firearms. The polytechnic shooting or domestic violence can be committed just as easily with any of the guns that are not prohibited. They try to make the argument that this ban reduces the number of guns, but the compensation program was designed for owners to replace their \"bad\" models with \"acceptable\" ones. Gun ownership and firearms sales have only increased so if you try to steelman this argument, you quickly realize they want very very restrictive control and have hinted at things like centralized storage and making all but the most basic and low capacity fire arms illegal. They even posted pictures of precision bolt actions and called for them to be banned or call 22lrs weapons of war. The sad part is Polysesouvient and the LPC created the system we have had for 30 years, and it's been recognized as one of the best in the world with many countries modeling their own off ours. They just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nThen there is the LPC. Part of these bans was reactionary to the shooting in Nova Scotia in 2020, but we know now that it was policy they already were working on, a solution in search of a problem. It's good political currency. Most people are ignorant of our laws (or at least they used to be, I'm seeing more people are educating themselves), polling always indicates people support gun control because they don't understand how good our system already was. It's a good divisive currency. It cuts a hard line between the LPC and the CPC, and it's easy to spin it as one party is protecting Canadains, and one wants American style gun culture. If you look at the gun ban announcements, they started when the LPC became a minority government and almost always announced when they were polling poorly, it's part of why they have always been so poorly thought-out and implemented. The government intentionally selected people with views aligned with their pre determined outcome to make the policy and ignore experts and data even going as far as to remove the NDP safety critic from the committee when he raised concerns. \n\nAnother part is social media. We live in a world where we are constantly updated and open to more \"news\" and information than ever. People blur the lines between American issues and our own. There's also a massive issue with morons making terrible arguments on behalf of Canadian gun owners, in my experience, factually wrong ones by people who probably don't have a license or don't own guns effected by these bans. Or people using their military, Leo, or alleged firearms ownership experience to make arguments against gun ownership. The gun community itself has idiots that insist on posting pictures of their guns or shooting targets in tactical gear online. Logical people can step back from this and see it for what it is, but when the issue becomes politically charged, people will take any \"evidence\" that guns are toxic or dangerous to make their point. \n\nThe sad part is with all this fentanyl trade war shit, we had a very good argument about border control and contraband in guns, but I watch interview after interview of LPC minsters talking about the border and intentionally avoiding acknowledging it. Because they know where the problem is coming from, and they know we can't solve it easily or that the effort to do so are broad, small efforts that combined over time will reduce gun crime in Canada, but they aren't big policy's that can be announced for political points and some things would be unpopular with their base, increasing law enforcement spending and resources which at the time of the gun bans was peak ACAB, BLM, defund the police movement. A big part of it is that the government would have to admit that they have neglected, created, or accelerated social economic conditions that account for most of the gun crime in our country. No politician wants to say that cost of living, inflation, poverty, education, immigration, the justice system, or other things have declined, and it's made crime more appealing. The gun ban and \"buy back\" is a massive red herring, unfortunately. \n\nThe LPC also doesn't seem to have a problem spending billions (I've seen estimates of biliion, and the failed long gun registration cost 3 billion, so it's not hard to believe). I can't decide if they just don't care about the cost or they truly believe it's going to be worth it, or  they are just completely unaware of the reality of it. I'm leaning on the latter. \n\nThe last part is hard for people to swallow and can easily come off as insensitive. The reality is that gun crime is not really a major issue in Canada. It's just that our perspective is skewed, and we are driven by emotion because it's often a traumatic and horrible things and people will be unreasonable when it comes to any effort to reduce it. It is, unfortunately, probably always going to be part of our society.","created_utc":1744311851,"date":"2025-04-10","id":"mmfqwlz","link_id_short":"1jv23rm","parent_id":"t1_mmfeatj","party":"NDP","permalink":"/r/canada/comments/1jv23rm/surge_in_young_gun_owners_hitting_voting_age_amid/mmfqwlz/","score":1,"subreddit":"canada","targeted_sentence":"part of it is about political tribalism, guns are seen as a \"right wing\" issue, and some left-wing people are on board to punish people they disagree with politically. the government intentionally selected people with views aligned with their pre determined outcome to make the policy and ignore experts and data even going as far as to remove the ndp safety critic from the committee when he raised concerns","title":"Surge in young gun owners hitting voting age amid calls in firearm circles to loosen bans","trans_sentiment":0,"week":15,"vader_score":-0.6597}

{"author":"No-Fig-2126","body":"Liberal Leader Mark Carney is promising to create a defence purchasing agency to speed up military equipment procurement and prioritize buying Canadian products and materials whenever possible.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign stop at a Bombardier Inc. facility in Dorval, Que., Mr. Carney on Monday pledged to create a “Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Science” to deliver what he called made-in-Canada solutions for the Canadian Armed Forces and the Communications Security Establishment, the country’s signals interception and cyber-protection agency.\n\nCarney says Liberal staffers who planted Trump-style buttons at conservative event have been reassigned\n\nHe framed the promise as a response to threats to Canada’s sovereignty from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed tariffs on many Canadian goods and has repeatedly talked of making the country the 51st U.S. state.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“We will protect our sovereignty in an increasingly dangerous and divided world by rebuilding, reinvesting, and rearming our military,” Mr. Carney said in a statement.\n\n“In the process, we will support made-in-Canada defence procurement, while also helping our industries and businesses reach new markets around the world.”\n\nHe said the new procurement agency would prioritize the use of Canadian raw materials such as steel, aluminum, and critical minerals.\n\nThe Liberal Leader said Ottawa under this commitment would centralize decision-making on procurement and give Ottawa more discretion to waive procurement rules when necessary.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA Carney government, he said, would provide the agency “with greater powers and flexibility, so that there are exceptions, for example, with respect to the level of competition that’s required in terms of defence contracting, speed with which contracts can be struck,” and prioritization for “Canadian suppliers and the Canadian supply chain that’s going to deliver it.”\n\nOther measures he promised include advancing Canada’s involvement in the ReArm Europe Plan in support of transatlantic security, “and prioritizing investment here in Canada – with every dollar spent wisely and effectively.”\n\nMr. Carney’s Monday promise echoes a 2019 Liberal campaign pledge to create a separate procurement agency, which at the time the party said would be called Defence Procurement Canada. Former prime minister Justin Trudeau’s government never set up such an agency after the 2019 election.","created_utc":1744672771,"date":"2025-04-14","id":"mn59n6r","link_id_short":"1jzcp6u","parent_id":"t3_1jzcp6u","party":"Conservative","permalink":"/r/canada/comments/1jzcp6u/carney_promises_to_launch_agency_to_make_defence/mn59n6r/","score":6,"subreddit":"canada","targeted_sentence":"carney says liberal staffers who planted trump-style buttons at conservative event have been reassigned\n\nhe framed the promise as a response to threats to canada’s sovereignty from u. president donald trump, who has imposed tariffs on many canadian goods and has repeatedly talked of making the country the 51st u","title":"Carney promises to launch agency to make defence purchasing faster, more Canadian","trans_sentiment":0,"week":16,"vader_score":-0.2023}

{"author":"69Bandit","body":"I decided to look into the silk road founder guy. He facillitated the sale of weapons, drugs and even tried to hire a hit man to murder one of his co-workers when he turned informant, he had 183 million dollars in bitcoins (2014, so 42.1 Billion dollars today... crazy) He was charged with 7 offenses. \"distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering.\" he was sentenced to double life imprisonment plus 40 years without parole. Aka, 90 Years in Jail. Seems extreme to me personally. Average sentence for trafficking drugs is just under 7 years,  Identity Documents gets 3.5 years, 6 years for money laundering. The rest seem to be just addons. total of 16.5 years on average, parole would be out in 10\\~. This fella served 12 years, so worst case scenario i would say trump shaved 4.5 years off his sentence. the scale of what he facilitated was definitely larger, but with certain states and even our own BC legalizing the sale of hard drugs. His punishment didnt fit the crime, in my opinion. I think it would of been kinder to execute him rather then imprison him for his entire possible life.  But thats just my opinion and not really relevant... Sorry, went on a bit of a side tangent with that, because i found it really interesting. \n\nAnywhos, i don't know exactly what his plan is, terrifs seem to be aimed more at convincing US businesses to return to the US and trying to make Canada look like a bad place for US companies to Invest in and it will just compound on our leaderships previous poor choices. \n\nHis Tax for consumers and tax cuts for wealthy may have other merits to it? i am not sure since thats strictly an American problem. \n\nI am unsure what you mean by the boarder control issues have already been addressed, as far as i am aware nothing physical has been done yet. however, i am sure someone could just mail him a picture of a wall with a canadian flag on it and he would not infact check that it was built, or question how it was built instantly.  I don't believe his teriffs on Mexico and Canada are anything more then a Stunt for the broader American public, but i don't believe putting -This- liberal party forward as the best candidate for dealing with trump is a good thing, while they may have been historically successful i don't believe they are the same and i think that a conservative government with more in common and less history of backstabbing and slandering the egotistical president of the united states as the better candidates.  \n\nThere is still a possibility he is using threats against Canada specifically to expidite the removal of the Liberal/NDP government because of slights against him and doing the same to make the Mexican  We still have the USMCA/CUSMA agreement, which he will have to violate. I will not put it past him to do so stating \"Bad Deal for America\" etc.\n\nUltimately, what we know is Trump is a complete loose cannon. If Kow-Towing gets us further burned, we can fall back to retalitory Teriffs, but before thats needed there is an chance that the right people can resolve this entirely with the current trade agreements intact for the most part.","created_utc":1737629657,"date":"2025-01-23","id":"m8pd9mi","link_id_short":"1i6roeb","parent_id":"t1_m8hvngn","party":"Conservative","permalink":"/r/canada/comments/1i6roeb/bc_first_nations_leader_reverses_stance_on/m8pd9mi/","score":1,"subreddit":"canada","targeted_sentence":"first nations leader reverses stance on northern gateway pipeline after trump i decided to look into the silk road founder guy. this fella served 12 years, so worst case scenario i would say trump shaved 4. i don't believe his teriffs on mexico and canada are anything more then a stunt for the broader american public, but i don't believe putting -this- liberal party forward as the best candidate for dealing with trump is a good thing, while they may have been historically successful i don't believe they are the same and i think that a conservative government with more in common and less history of backstabbing and slandering the egotistical president of the united states as the better candidates. ultimately, what we know is trump is a complete loose cannon","title":"B.C.

{"author":"080128","body":"A part of me truly does believe this is all talk just to try and scare Canada into caving on various items. And to be fair, there are some areas we could in fact do better, like, can we please just meet the NATO defence spending target we agreed to years ago? There's no excuse not to and it would help alleviate some of the discourse between the US and Canada. But, why on earth a republican government would want a new state that is for the most part OVERWHELMINGLY left or centre/left is beyond me. They would immediately have a state that would fill the house with what, 45 or 50 of democratic congress people, plus a few democratic senators (even more if they absorbed Canada and just made our provinces states, vs Canada being 1 big state)... not to mention 40 million citizens who would never ever let another republican government be elected for as long as we live. There's just no logic to this. Which is why I really don't believe they truly want Canada to be a state. It would royally screw them over. So yeah, that's my opinion. Scare us into thinking they're going to take us, in order to make us pick up that slack in areas we've been lacking. The Democrats... now they would LOVE Canada to be a state haha, they'd be in power forever. \n\nBut much like the rest of what comes out of that orange dirty hole some would call a mouth, there's just no logic.","created_utc":1741890427,"date":"2025-03-13","id":"mhlxwol","link_id_short":"1jaib2x","parent_id":"t3_1jaib2x","party":"Conservative","permalink":"/r/canada/comments/1jaib2x/only_works_as_a_state_trump_vows_not_to_bend_on/mhlxwol/","score":1,"subreddit":"canada","targeted_sentence":"‘only works as a state’: trump vows not ‘to bend’ on tariffs until canada is absorbed into the u","title":"‘Only Works as a State’: Trump Vows Not ‘To Bend’ On Tariffs Until Canada Is Absorbed Into The U.S.","trans_sentiment":1,"week":11,"vader_score":0.0}

{"author":"SnackSauce","body":"People commenting about how it's the future and China is going all in right now and doing great.... those two things are absolutely true, but completely unrelated to the \\*reasoning\\* as to why we should have rebates.\n\n1. The main reason we should NOT is infrastructure. We don't have the infrastructure in place to support mass people switching to EV's, in any province. Objectively, regardless of who you vote for, it will be minimum a decade before we have the infrastructure in place to support just the CHARGING aspect. That does NOT include power generation increase, so tack on another decade on top of that. Nuclear, hydro, etc... doesn't matter what it is. We'll need more.\n\n2. We don't have the ability (yet) to mass produce EV's domestically. Plants are currently being built (kind of).\n\n3. EV's are barely affordable with the rebate, and without it they are still too expensive. Even with the rebate, most people still can't afford them. They are simply too expensive, mainly due to #2 above.\n\nAll 3 things above China has concurred already. They have the infrastructure in place, they produce their EV's domestically, and they are relatively affordable in comparison to the $ here.\n\nCanada simply and factually is not ready for a mass switch to EV's. Having a rebate currently really doesn't do much and just exacerbates the start of the infrastructure problem. The only thing that is happening is the people in that little bubble zone that can almost afford an EV get your tax money free to help them. It's mostly a waste of tax payer money, and does an extremely insignificant amount to 'improve the environment' on a full Canadian domestic scale or larger.\n\nThis is not a Conservative view, this is not a Liberal view and this is not an NDP view. It's unbiased fact, with no political undertones. Removing the rebate is fiscally responsible vs the overall benefit it provides. There is a thing called a CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis) that fiscally responsible governments and companies do for a reason, and this is a good example.\n\nI'm all for the rebate when Canada is truly ready for a mass switch, to incentivize most of the population to do so to make a real impact, but now is not the time.

{"author":"Alarmed_Influence_21","body":"OK, I'll give you the 'lazy fuckers can't be bothered to do their own research' answers.\n\nThere's a court case against the federal government in process right now. It was filed in Ontario, and specifically involved the NSICOP committee. For years our Five Eyes partners have been trying to get Canada to establish a permanent parliamentary body that oversees government Intelligence activities, specifically with an eye to keeping the proper balance of personal liberties vs national security. The other four nations already have them in place. We don't. SECU is a standing committee, and can be dissolved, so it doesn't qualify, even if does most of the same work.\n\nBut ... Trudeau didn't build NSICOP the way the other four Five Eyes members did. They made their new bodies so ithey answer to Parliament (or Congress in the US's case), seeing as it's supposed to be Parliamentary oversight. Trudeau made it part of the Government of Canada structure. The PM and PMO name its members, and Cabinet vets all the committee's output, with veto and redaction power. They put even more stringent controls on the members, such as lifetime silence, incarceration as the penalty for violation, and specifically limited parliamentary privilege. \n\nAgain, all of this is a deviation from the other four Five Eyes members and how theirs are built.\n\nWhy? Because when our Winnipeg disease center was compromised by two Chinese agents, the reports went to SECU, and under the auspices of parliamentary privilege, they closed the doors of parliament and chose to fully inform all the sitting MPs of what was going on. They named names, etc.\n\nTrudeau was furious with this, because that information was ultimately used to attack his government's handling of that crisis, so when he made NSICOP, he intentionally put it fully under the control of Cabinet and the PMO.\n\nAnd ... if you've followed this to the end, every report NSICOP makes is also bound by the same limitations. You sign up to get that data, you are ALSO voiding your parliamentary privilege, and cannot talk about the contents in parliament. You're also bound for life to secrecy, and they reserve the right to imprison you if you violate that.\n\nThe court case is arguing that parliament is supposed to be supreme, and the NSICOP requirement that voids parliamentary privilege a) voids the requirement of the committee to be a check on government power and abuse, and b) puts government above parliament, rather than the normal positioning.\n\nThe Ontario Government held for the complainant. The Appellate layer held for the Government. Now it's off to the SCC for handling.\n\nUntil that issue around parliamentary privilege is ironed out, why the fuck would Poilievre sign up for a life long noose, possible incarceration, and to void his parliamentary privilege? There's already been one CSIS leak (surveillance request for a Liberal campaign manager by CSIS that went unhandled for 58 days) that was brought up in parliament and used to attack the government. Why would he give up the right to use that kind of leak?\n\nThe rest were desperate/dumb enough to take the bait, but not Poilievre.","created_utc":1742923686,"date":"2025-03-25","id":"mjotrx5","link_id_short":"1jjku0i","parent_id":"t1_mjoiwsu","party":"Liberal","permalink":"/r/canada/comments/1jjku0i/carney_slams_poilievres_irresponsible_lack_of/mjotrx5/","score":2,"subreddit":"canada","targeted_sentence":"carney slams poilievre's 'irresponsible' lack of security clearance after reports india meddled in leadership ok, i'll give you the 'lazy fuckers can't be bothered to do their own research' answers. trudeau didn't build nsicop the way the other four five eyes members did. trudeau made it part of the government of canada structure. trudeau was furious with this, because that information was ultimately used to attack his government's handling of that crisis, so when he made nsicop, he intentionally put it fully under the control of cabinet and the pmo. there's already been one csis leak (surveillance request for a liberal campaign manager by csis that went unhandled for 58 days) that was brought up in parliament and used to attack the government","title":"Carney slams Poilievre's 'irresponsible' lack of security clearance after reports India meddled in leadership","trans_sentiment":0,"week":13,"vader_score":-0.974}

He wants change, and this ad is definitely targeting what they think of his demographic.\n\nWhat this ad fails to realize is that younger boomers are the larger portion of the surviving boomer population and now dominate boomer-era voter turnout. Younger Boomers lean progressive, but are often torn between NDP ideals and Liberal pragmatism. They grew up with more economic uncertainty than older boomers, rising inflation, and cracks in social services. They were politically aware during the rise of the environmental movement, labour activism, and second-wave feminism in the 1970s–1980s.\n\nMy dad worked his entire life in a hard manual position that often required more 50 hour weeks, was a union steward, always lower middle class, loves nature, wants Canadians to have access to affordable housing, healthcare, and social services, and always voted NDP even though he is fiscally a centrist. He also wants more domestic production and manufacturing over resource extraction for export.\n\nHarper gutted social services, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, weakened environmental protections with Omnibus Bills (C-38 and C-45), supported and expanded the oil sands, was over reliant on oil and resource extraction, cut programs in areas like veterans’ affairs, environment, and science, increased corporate tax breaks while freezing wages, raised the age of retirement, and undermined collective bargaining. \n\nThe change my dad wants to see is not a return to Harper.

{"author":"LemmingPractice","body":">I think your argument on rights makes sense. For example, gun rights are one that I don't think people should have, and I'll own that as left wing. However, I think that the right to healthcare and bodily autonomy in abortions is a very left wing policy that is also very pro freedom and rights, something that the right wing is almost unanimously opposed to.\n\nThis is inaccurate and a strawman.\n\nFor both gun rights and abortion rights they are not strictly left or right. As with many controversial rights, they situations where two sets of rights come into conflict, and so there is no right or left answer.\n\nFor gun rights, for instance, you are balancing the freedom of people to use a gun, and the right to protect oneself, against the rights of others to life, liberty and security.\n\nThe balancing of interests plays out differently depending on the types of guns and the restrictions. So, for instance, hunting rifles have a different context than automatic machine guns or weapons than can be easily concealed.\n\nFor abortion, the conflict of rights comes between the woman's right to choose and the fetus' right to live. Without getting into a lengthy abortion  conversation, the majority of Canadian conservatives support the right to abortion (opppsitioj to abortion in the CPC is somewhere in the 30% range, largely played up by the Liberals for fearmongering purposes), but that one isn't really a left vs right, because neither left or right determines whether a fetus has a right to life.\n\nTo be frank, abortion rights largely come down to the fact that women can vote and fetuses can't. That's nothing to do with left or right, that's just old fashioned self-interest.\n\n>The power of the collective will always be regarded as the \"good guy\", even if that's merely opinion, because on the whole it is always true; it is only in extreme circumstances where the individual matters more than the needs of the many or the needs of the few.\n\nTheoretically, perhaps, but the philosophy ignores human nature.\n\nHumans are self-interested, and have a tendency to justify their own self-interest as the \"greater good\", hence, why we can't get any real agreement on what the greater good actually is.\n\nPower corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is because humans are very good at justifying the morality of things that happen to be in their own best interest.\n\nBig government means less checks on the power of government, centralized power in the hands of a few (and, ultimately, the hands of one, at the top). The result is that you don't get the greater good, you get corruption, oppression, etc.\n\nThis is why left wing politics lead to authoritarianism. It's a philosophy that attracts authoritarian because it is a philosophy that embraces the maximum concentration in that power of that authoritarian.\n\n>Regardless of which theoretical party ideology is upheld, the individual actions of each government on a case by case basis should be examined and judged. There's a lot of right wing parties with big government ideas, and a lot of left wing parties supporting individual rights. The water is muddy because terms and values have evolved over decades, and things no longer fit in the nice neat boxes we once had.\n\nI'll disagree on the left wing governments supporting individual rights (virtue-signaling, or embracing popular rights that don't need protection doesn't count as protecting individual rights, in my book), but I fully agree that some right wing governments will drift into big government policies. This is a natural human tendency, as I discussed above.\n\nBut, the actions of people who claim one side or the other doesn't change what those sides mean.\n\nThe boxes are imperfect, as with any system that tries to lump all politician beliefs into two boxes, but more often than not, the terms have lost meaning because of the desire of people to muddy the meaning of the side of their opponents.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are right, we should judge individuals and parties by their own actions. But, your abortion example is a perfect example of how modern politics has devolved into left wingers defining the right based on the self-interested fearmongering of left wing politicians, as opposed to what the right wing politicians at issue actually say they stand for.","created_utc":1745724393,"date":"2025-04-26","id":"mp99j5l","link_id_short":"1k4kqu7","parent_id":"t1_mp8y8e2","party":"Conservative","permalink":"/r/CanadianPolitics/comments/1k4kqu7/poilievre_has_a_message_for_immigrants_bring_your/mp99j5l/","score":1,"subreddit":"canadianpolitics","targeted_sentence":"poilievre has a message for immigrants: \"bring your culture, bring your traditions, bring your family, but do not bring foreign conflicts onto our streets. however, i think that the right to healthcare and bodily autonomy in abortions is a very left wing policy that is also very pro freedom and rights, something that the right wing is almost unanimously opposed to. without getting into a lengthy abortion  conversation, the majority of canadian conservatives support the right to abortion (opppsitioj to abortion in the cpc is somewhere in the 30% range, largely played up by the liberals for fearmongering purposes), but that one isn't really a left vs right, because neither left or right determines whether a fetus has a right to life. there's a lot of right wing parties with big government ideas, and a lot of left wing parties supporting individual rights. i'll disagree on the left wing governments supporting individual rights (virtue-signaling, or embracing popular rights that don't need protection doesn't count as protecting individual rights, in my book), but i fully agree that some right wing governments will drift into big government policies. but, your abortion example is a perfect example of how modern politics has devolved into left wingers defining the right based on the self-interested fearmongering of left wing politicians, as opposed to what the right wing politicians at issue actually say they stand for","title":"Poilievre has a message for immigrants: \"Bring your culture, bring your traditions, bring your family, but do not bring foreign conflicts onto our streets.\"","trans_sentiment":1,"week":17,"vader_score":0.9915}

I think by the end he was pretty out of touch, but I’m not sure he took any affirmative actions that like… were terrible.  Correct me if I’m wrong.\n\nHarper was in the process of deregulating our housing market by 2008 (https://thetyee.ca/Views/2008/10/08/HarperEcon/) and would have positioned Canada in a catastrophically bad place when the 2008 crisis hit if he’d been in power for longer.  He shut down libraries and research institutions because they published results he didnt like.  He would basically never talk to the media.  He muzzled scientists to the degree that they had to go like four levels up the PR chain to even have a basic public conversation.  He tried to implement a racially-coded “barbaric cultural practices tip line” (championed by PP).  If he’d had his way Canada would have gone to war in Iraq.  These are massive issues that, in my mind, pale to JT’s uninspired leadership on things like housing.\n\nTo me JT was fine but didnt meet the moment.

In fact, if those two were to mate, I’m reasonably convinced we’d have a [Gozer-type situation](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbnNvN3o2NzB4Z3hhdHA4ODNuMDlhaW1hdG81cm5nZGR5eGN2cndkcCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/tlLBddTfaJmJG/giphy.gif).\n\nO’Toole had my respect as a veteran, but as a politician, he flip-flopped too much trying to appeal to the center. Given a choice between similar candidates, the Liberals can more effectively wield fears over gay rights and abortion to their advantage.\n\nPoilievre is the closest thing to a Thatcherite I’ve ever seen in this country. Thatcher battled state enterprise—bloated, inefficient, and uncompetitive—and what we have now is much closer to that than a healthy free market. We have a highly concentrated corporate sector that’s captured the state. We desperately need competition for capitalism to work for everyone, not just the elites. Corporate concentration is why our prices are higher and our pay is lower than those of our contemporaries. It should concern you that the layman’s solution to every economic setback always seems to be more subsidies, more concentration, or simply nationalize the damn thing. That’s not capitalism. In a healthy system, no single industry is dominated by the same half-dozen large players in perpetuity, small businesses grow into medium ones, which then grow and eventually supplant the large companies. And at every stage, some businesses will fail so we can learn, and the best can rise, allowing businesses to fail so the state doesn’t, which is the state’s job: to ensure a healthy churn that leads to innovation.\n\nI finally joined the party specifically because of Pierre because I think he gets it better than most.","created_utc":1742864432,"date":"2025-03-24","id":"mjkwcr2","link_id_short":"1jj4l88","parent_id":"t3_1jj4l88","party":"Conservative","permalink":"/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1jj4l88/just_saying/mjkwcr2/","score":1,"subreddit":"canadianconservative","targeted_sentence":"poilievre is the closest thing to a thatcherite i’ve ever seen in this country","title":"Just Saying...","trans_sentiment":1,"week":13,"vader_score":0.0}

{"author":"arcadianahana","body":"The one most significant  thing that benefited my household the most out of Trudeau's regime was the National Childcare Program and the funding the feds put behind the Canada-Provincial childcare agreements. And I credit the federal NDP for helping to make that happen. \n\n\nIt meant I'm spending thousands less on childcare compared to my friends who had kids before me. With some, the expense of childcare meant their careers and earning potential never fully took off becuase financially it only made sense for them to be stay at home moms until their kids were in school. I recognize there are Canadians out there who are equally benefiting from the dental and pharmacare programs that the NDP helped arm-twist into reality. \n\n\nI've never voted federal NDP before and there were several other policies that the Liberals pursued that pissed me off enough to vote Conservative the last two elections.  My support is behind the Carney led Liberals this time, but I don't deny that the NDP has done more to benefit individual Canadians than the CPC has done as a much large party in opposition. \n\n\nAlso, Poilievre only commits to maintain the national childcare program for those already benefiting. That means with the CPC, if you have another kid or you have your first kid in the future, it's a crap shoot whether you are back to paying the equivalent of a rental apartment monthly for daycare. That would be a damaging outcome for Gen Z.

{"author":"imaginary48","body":"This phenomenon is very explainable and not a mystery. I’m a young male who falls into this demographic, and while I don’t align with the Conservatives, I understand why this is happening and it’s primarily economic. My generation has been systematically excluded from the economy and society. Most young people have only had the Liberals in power for their teenage years and adulthood, and what we’re currently doing as a country simply isn’t working. Rent and home prices have more than doubled in a decade, wages are suppressed, wealth inequality is growing, landlords have made out like bandits, the threat of climate change is being felt, essentials like groceries have rapidly become more expensive, and the immigration system was weaponized against workers. \n\nYoung people don’t just want change - they’re desperate for it - and while the Conservative’s policies wouldn’t actually help young people, they’ve positioned themselves to be that change and successfully courted this demographic. Even if you do everything right nowadays, like going to school and getting a decent job, young people still can’t move out of their parent’s house or are stuck living with roommates in a shitty overpriced apartment, struggle to find work, have no prospects of starting a family, and will never buy a home or retire comfortably like previous generations had the opportunity to. Then, on top of that, we’re told that it’s our fault, that other people had to work hard and didn’t always have it easy too, and that we need to preserve the Boomer’s “nest egg” and give them more OAS money from our taxes. Additionally, conservatism as an ideology looks to the past to inform the present, and while some things might be better today, the past looks much better for how things used to be when it comes to how the economy used to work.\n\nResulting from these economic issues, it has led to skepticism of institutions, the growing rejection of accepted values, and snowballing hopelessness. When this happens, it leads to populism, scapegoating, and, at worst, extremism. If we had the same (or better, as it should be between generations) opportunities and generational equality, this wouldn’t be happening and young people would likely still lean more progressive.","created_utc":1745711678,"date":"2025-04-26","id":"mp8cxp7","link_id_short":"1k8onw5","parent_id":"t3_1k8onw5","party":"Conservative","permalink":"/r/canada/comments/1k8onw5/young_canadians_favor_conservatives_in_election/mp8cxp7/","score":820,"subreddit":"canada","targeted_sentence":"young canadians favor conservatives in election despite trump threat this phenomenon is very explainable and not a mystery. i’m a young male who falls into this demographic, and while i don’t align with the conservatives, i understand why this is happening and it’s primarily economic. young people don’t just want change - they’re desperate for it - and while the conservative’s policies wouldn’t actually help young people, they’ve positioned themselves to be that change and successfully courted this demographic","title":"Young Canadians favor Conservatives in election despite Trump threat","trans_sentiment":0,"week":17,"vader_score":0.8547}

They purchased a few of their donors failing O&G shares as well which has given AIMCO some pretty sad returns in recent years.

Harper was a bit of an Alexander the Great, whose personal prestige with the Canadian Right kept everyone in line.

Temporary immigration should have been an easy wedge issue to get out in front on.

Russia isn’t run by a dictator, it’s being run by oligarchs, just like the US is. Oligarchy as a style of government is oppressive to their own people and anyone near them. NK is the perfect example of a Dictatorship, and the Third Reich is the perfect example of Facism (obviously but still). Modern day USA is nothing like the Third Reich. But it IS a lot like modern day Russia! Just because you can’t use the awesome overused word called facist, doesn’t mean he’s a good guy. It just means maybe a different almost equal modern word should be used. And save the gravity of that word for the actual proud boys and shit running around openly with swastika’s.\n\nMonarchy was the big bad word before ww2 during the culture shift away from kings and queens, Facism was the big bad word from ww2 til the Cold War (ish, I’m generalizing timelines here), and communism was the big bad word til about 1990’s. Then it was the ‘middle east’ around 9/11 and early 2000’s. And now it’s back to facism, where it should actually be Oligarchy’s. The world economic forum (WEF) owns so many governments, our own JT was a young officer or something of it actually, as was one of the recent Conservative Party leaders. Now USA is a Democratic Oligarchy, Russia is an Oligarchy disguised as a dictatorship. And China is basically the Communist Oligarchy lol. \n\nTl:dr Not a Facist at all, an Oligarch.

{"author":"Kellervo","body":"> The real insight is that the conservatives were probably never that popular - Trudeau was just that incredibly unpopular to make the CPC (and NDP to an extent) viable in polling.\n\nIt's been my favorite stat, but exactly this. Even at his peak, a little over 1 in 4 Conservative voters *at best* didn't approve of Poilievre. His favorability was pretty consistently ten points under his party's polling, which historically is indicative of either a leader dragging the party down, or the party being the beneficiary of protest voters.\n\nNow the protest voters have swung now that they feel their voices have been heard,  but there's still a clear gap - eg. Poilievre's favorability among the younger demographics is still incredibly out of line with voting intentions (31% favorable vs. 40%~ voting intention among 18-34). Not good when those demographics historically are the most prone to low turnout.\n\nTL;DR - CPC made a fundamental error in assuming people were voting for them out of agreement and not protest, and as a result there's even more room for the CPC to bleed if they keep taking their current demographics for granted. Even if Poilievre were to win, he'd have little mandate assuming office as one of the least popular PMs in history.","created_utc":1741028199,"date":"2025-03-03","id":"mftqepr","link_id_short":"1j2nser","parent_id":"t1_mft9ld9","party":"Liberal","permalink":"/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/1j2nser/the_conservatives_have_had_the_rug_pulled_out/mftqepr/","score":4,"subreddit":"canadapolitics","targeted_sentence":"the conservatives have had the rug pulled out from under them > the real insight is that the conservatives were probably never that popular - trudeau was just that incredibly unpopular to make the cpc (and ndp to an extent) viable in polling","title":"The Conservatives have had the rug pulled out from under them","trans_sentiment":0,"week":10,"vader_score":-0.3252}

Carney is on record saying the tax we had wasn’t high enough. He’s talked about changing it to a shadow carbon tax on industries, in addition to the existing industrial carbon tax, which will just get passed on to consumers. He also didn’t eliminate the tax, he reduced the rate to 0. The law is still in place and can be raised again at anytime. There already have been MPs talking about it coming back. He also didn’t touch the existing industrial or agricultural carbon tax and wants to implement carbon tariffs, that is tariffs on imports from countries without a carbon tax. Finally there is Carney’s book Values. In his book it’s clear he values net 0 above all else and will do anything to achieve that ends regardless of the economic impact. For the other taxes his massive deficits won’t allow it.
